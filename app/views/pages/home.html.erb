      <h2>Hi, I'm @CrazyDancingGuy</h2>
      <p>I love to dance, and so I do it a lot.  Often, when I'm out dancing, people watch or even record my antics.</p>
      <p>The other day I thought, "if I am going to spend hours every week with people watching me dance, I might as well seize that opportunity to speak up for the things I care about."</p>
      <p>So I created the CrazyDancingGuy persona.  Now when I go out dancing, I will wear a shirt in support of climate justice, gender equality and social justice.</p>
      <p>My shirt will also encourage onlookers to share dancing videos / pics and tag the causes they care about.</p>
      <p>It's a crazy idea.  It may not work at all.  But I'm going have fun trying.  Why not?</p>
